Musicale
========

Musicale is my foray into Android Lollipop. It is a music app that leverages the LastFm api to find music events, trends, and people based on my music preferences and location. It is still under construction and is intended for my own personal use and exploration into Android development and design.

Note: APIs 17+ supported (4.2+)
